The frequency field is now strictly constrained to have one of three formats: HP:0003577 (a term from the frequency subontology) or 12/45 or 22% <br>2. There is a field that can indicate sex-limited phenotypes<br>3. There is a field that can be used to record terms from the HPO ClLinical modifier subontology (e.g., 'bilateral' or 'transient')<br>4. The Aspect field has been updated to reflect the fact that annotations can come out of the subontologies Phenotypic abnormality, Inheritance, Clinical course, or Clinical Modifier. <br><br>The new annotation file is located on our <a href='http://compbio.charite.de/jenkins/job/hpo.annotations.2018/'>Jenkins server</a> and is called phenotype.hpoa.<br>Feedback on the format is welcome. We also welcome feedback on the question whether the practice of having a separate file for negative (NOT) phenotype annotations should be maintained, since we are considering putting all information in one file (the negative lines have a NOT in column 4 in both new and old formats).<br><br>Please contact peter.robinson@jax.org with questions or comments.",

          "body": "Today we would like to inform you about <a href='https://phenotero.github.io/aboutme/'>Phenotero</a>.<br><br>The rationale behind Phenotero is that in precision medicine, especially in clinical genetics, the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) as well as disease ontologies like the Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO) or Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) are often used for ‘deep phenotyping’ of patients and coding of clinical diagnoses. This is especially important because it allows for streamlining of clinic workflow and efficient data entry, and will subsequently promote clinical and molecular diagnosis, remove ambiguousness from manuscripts, and enable sharing of anonymised patient phenotype data with ultimate goal of a better understanding of diseases.<br><br>However, the process of assigning ontology classes to patient descriptions is often disconnected from the process of writing patient reports or manuscripts in word processing software such as Microsoft Word or LibreOffice. This additional workload and the requirement to install dedicated software may discourage usage of ontologies for parts of the target audience. Retrospectively applied text-mining suffers from inaccuracies, noise, and often privacy constraints.<br><br>To improve this situation, we developed Phenotero, a freely available and simple solution to annotate patient phenotypes and diseases at the time of writing clinical reports or manuscripts. We adopt Zotero, a well-established, actively developed citation management software to generate a tool which allows to reference classes from ontologies within clinical reports or manuscripts at the time of writing. <br><br><br><br>Please contact sebastian.koehler@charite.de with questions or comments.",

This so-called terminology-gap can impede participation of patients and families in research projects concerned with the phenotype or natural history of diseases, and can even make it difficult for patients to understand data from their own medical charts.<br><br> The HPO Project and the Monarch Initiative have therefore “translated” the terms of the HPO into “plain language”. For instance, the term for <i>Macrocephaly</i> can be translated as <i>Large skull</i>. <br><br> This joint project with the Monarch-Initiative, HPO, PCORI, Sanford Medical, and a lot of other contributors on adding layperson synonyms to HPO has now been published in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0096-x\">Nature Genetics</a>.",
