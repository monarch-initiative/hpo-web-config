This is especially important because it allows for streamlining of clinic workflow and efficient data entry, and will subsequently promote clinical and molecular diagnosis, remove ambiguousness from manuscripts, and enable sharing of anonymised patient phenotype data with ultimate goal of a better understanding of diseases.<br><br>However, the process of assigning ontology classes to patient descriptions is often disconnected from the process of writing patient reports or manuscripts in word processing software such as Microsoft Word or LibreOffice. This additional workload and the requirement to install dedicated software may discourage usage of ontologies for parts of the target audience. Retrospectively applied text-mining suffers from inaccuracies, noise, and often privacy constraints.<br><br>To improve this situation, we developed Phenotero, a freely available and simple solution to annotate patient phenotypes and diseases at the time of writing clinical reports or manuscripts. We adopt Zotero, a well-established, actively developed citation management software to generate a tool which allows to reference classes from ontologies within clinical reports or manuscripts at the time of writing. <br><br><br><br>Please contact sebastian.koehler@charite.de with questions or comments.",
